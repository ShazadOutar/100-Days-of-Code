#Instructions

#Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February. The reason why we have leap years is really fascinating, this video does it more justice:

#This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.
#on every year that is evenly divisible by 4 
#**except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 
#**unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
#if it's not divisible by 4, it's not a leap year
if year % 4 != 0:
    print("Not leap year.")
#if it's not divisble by 100 and is divisible by 4 it is a leap year
elif year % 100 != 0:
    print("Leap year.")
#if it's divisible by 4 and is divisible by 100 and is divisible by 400, then it's a leap year
elif year % 400 != 0:
    print("Leap year.")
#otherwise it's not a leap year
else:
    print("Not leap year.")
